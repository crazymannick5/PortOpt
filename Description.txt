The Portfolio Optimization project demonstrates the use of advanced mathematical
and computational techniques to maximize returns and minimize risk in financial 
portfolios. By leveraging concepts like data preprocessing, return calculation, 
and Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), this project provides a practical 
workflow for building efficient investment strategies. Key features include a 
modular data-handling system that integrates with real-time data sources, 
customizable parameters for return calculations, and optimization constraints 
that align with diverse financial goals.

This project highlights the application of robust mathematical models, such as 
covariance matrices and risk-return tradeoff analysis, within a clean, scalable 
codebase. Visualization tools like the efficient frontier and performance 
metrics ensure transparency and usability, making it an excellent demonstration 
of applied financial engineering for professionals and enthusiasts alike.
